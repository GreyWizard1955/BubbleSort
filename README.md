# BubbleSort

# I started with alca's (from "The Coding Train" slack channel) suggestion. Showing the shuffle, then the sort.

# Using the base of 360, you can use count, or * count by 2 to 20, or / count by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30 or 36.

# Using sound effects and other items to entertain. Enjoy!
